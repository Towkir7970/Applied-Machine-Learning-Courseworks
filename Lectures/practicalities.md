## About the course

Students who complete this course successfully will be aware of the *practical implementation and usage* of **machine learning** algorithms. Furthermore, they will be able to *apply machine learning algorithms* in *real problems* using efficient programming languages, for example Python.

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "subslide"}}

### Requirements to pass the course
 1. 50% implementation of weekly exercises 
 1. Report of the group project exceeds the passing criteria
    1. The problem of the task is clearly presented
    1. The data used for solving the problem is clearly documented
    1. The data preprocessing and feature calculation is clearly justified, explained and implemented. Excellent report cites research literature to justify the case.
    1. Appropriate machine learning algorithms are chosen, the choice is rationally justified indicating knowledge of various machine learning methods, and the implementation is cleanly coded and explained using comments in the code. Again excellent report cites research literature in this phase.
    1. The results are reported using high quality graphics and University's document template. The graphs in the excellent report are of publication quality and they are correctly referenced in the text.
 1. Acting as an opponent of at least one report.
 
The report is written using the writing guidelines of University of Vaasa. Ready made templates for Word and Overleaf are provided in the following pages:
1. [Vaasan yliopiston kirjoitusohjeet](https://uva.libguides.com/kirjoitusohjeet)
1. [University of Vaasa, writing guidelines](https://uva.libguides.com/writingguidelines)
 
### Grade
The final grade is calculated based on points. The points can be gathered by solving weekly exercises and making the project work and writing a report of it. Maximum amount of points is shown in the following table:

 | Task | Exercise | 
 |------|------------|
 | Exercise 1 | 10 p |
 | Exercise 2 | 10 p |
 | Exercise 3 | 10 p |
 | Exercise 4 | 10 p |
 | Exercise 5 | 10 p |
 | Exercise 6 | 10 p |
 | Exercise 7 | 10 p |
 | Exercise 8 | 10 p |
 | Exercise 9 | 10 p |
 | Project work | 60 p |
 | **Total** | **150 p** |

### Weekly schedule

+++

The weekly activities are planned as follows. The planned time needed is shown in parentheses.

1. Read the theory material of the current week, and watch the video materials if you find them useful (4h)
1. Solve the week's exercises and submit them (4h)
1. In case you have any problems, send a question to the [General discussion](https://moodle.uwasa.fi/mod/forum/view.php?id=373020) group.
1. If you find questions where you can answer, you may help the others by answering. For good answers, some extra points will be given. Do not give a direct answer to the problems though.
1. 30 hours is reserved for the course project in the end of the course.

### Solving exercises

+++

The exercises are given in the form of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), which are kind of interactive documents, which you are suppose fill according to the instructions in the notebook. You can run them in Google Colab, Binder or in a Jupyter environment which you install in your own computer.

When you have finished the notebook, download it from Jupyter in notebook format (`.ipynb`) and upload the notebook in Moodle.
