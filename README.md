## Course Overview

The "Applied Machine Learning" course focuses on diving into the essentials of Python programming, data manipulation, and visualization. Furthermore, exploring the intricacies of preprocessing, feature extraction, and both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques. Evaluating and optimizing models waas a crucial part of the journey, and the course was wrapped up by delving into the fascinating realm of neural networks. Throughout the course, there were various practical exercises using real life datasets covering different topics. Lastly, a thorough project was done and the documentations were written. By the end, students were able to independently approach machine learning tasks, armed with a toolkit of effective strategies for diverse applications.

## Projects

### Project: Water Quality Detection

In this project, we used machine learning techniques to develop an autonomous system that can determine, based on a variety of water parameters, whether or not a given supply of water is potable. After thorough processing and implementation, we were able to achieve satisfactory performance from our applied machine learning algorithms. Dataset Link can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability).
